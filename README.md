### Question 1 (Depth-First Search)
This is implemented in the `depthFirstSearch` function in `search.py` . The function is based on the lecture algorithm, but with a slight modification: A state node is checked for **goal state** when it is about to be **expanded**, not when it is **produced** by the parent node, as described in the lecture, since the `autograder.py` test would fail in that case. As asked, the algorithm follows *graph-search*, chekcing whether each successor state is already stored in the *frontier*.
### Question 2 (Breadth-First Search)
`breadthFirstSearch` function in `search.py` also follows the *graph-search* lecture code, with the exception of the modification noted above.
### Question 3 (Uniform Cost Search)
Implemented in the `uniformCostSearch` function in `search.py` . Here, things change when a successor state is already in the frontier. In that case we find the cost of the new path, and if the stored path is more expensive, we update it. A tricky part is when we have such a case. A state is a tuple `(position, path)`. A successor that is already in the gueue, is stored with a different path than the one found when expanding. So just `update((state,new_path), new_cost)` will not work properly, because the element will not be found in the `PriorityQueue`. So we manually change it first by **reconstructing** the `PriorityQueue` node. This requires internally handling the `PriorityQueue`, through `heap`, which is not the most elegant solution, but it seemed to be the only choice.
### Question 4 (A-Star Search)
This is implemented in the `aStarSearch` function in `search.py`, which is identical with `uniformCostSearch`, but this time the cost of each state in the `PriorityQueue` contains the **heuristic** value for this state. To make things simpler, we use an `evalFunction` to do that and get the total sum.
### Question 5 (Corners Problem)
The `cornersProblem` class methods `getStartState`, `isGoalState` and `getSuccessors` are implemented as asked. Each state of the problem is a **tuple** `(position, visitedCorners)`, where `visitedCorners` is also a **tuple** with 4 elements, one for each corresponding corner of `self.corners`. An element is `True` if the corner has been visited, `False` otherwise. In a *goal state*, all 4 elements have to be `True`.
### Question 6 (Corners Problem Heuristic)
The `cornersHeuristic` in `searchAgents.py` works as follows:
- Find the distance between the current position and all the unvisited corners, using the information stored in the current state and the problem.
- Return the maximum of the distances found.

This heuristic is admissible, since all the corners will be visited in the end. As a result, we will eventually follow a path from the current position to the corner with the maximum distance, which will not be cheaper than the Manhattan Distance calculated.

### Question 7 (Food Heuristic)
Implemented in `foodHeuristic` in `searchAgents.py` . To estimate the potential cost between a state and a goal state, the heuristic works as follows:  
- First, find the **2 food dots** with the biggest *Manhattan Distance*. If there is only one dot, 0 will be found, as expected.
- Second, calculate the distance between the current position and each of the 2 dots found. Choose the **smaller**.
- Return the **sum** of those two.

The logic behind this is the following:
- The total solution path distance will definitely contain the maximum distance between two dots, since we have to visit both of them.
- And it will also contain the minimum distance between the current position and one of them, since we will eventually visit one of them first.

As a result, the heuristic will never overestimate the cost to the goal state.  
*"And what if only one food dot is left?"*  
In that case, 0 is found in the first step, and then we just calculate the distance between the current position and the dot, which is an admissible result.
### Question 8 (Path to closest dot)
The `AnyFoodSearchProblem` class `isGoalState` method is implemented as hinted. In this problem we just try to reach a food dot, so we check if there is a food dot in the current position and return `True` or `False` accordingly. To solve the *Closest Dot Problem*, the `findPathToClosestDot` function is implemented. We simply need to use an appropriate search function. In this case it is `breadthFirstSearch`, since it finds the "narrowest" possible solution, which in our case is the closest from the starting position (since all edges/actions have the same cost in the Pacman Maze).
