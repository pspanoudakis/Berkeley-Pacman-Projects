# Berkeley Pac-Man Projects 0, 1 & 2

This is a series of projects for the Winter 2020 [Artificial Intelligence I](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~ys02/) course on [DIT@UoA](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en).

## Project Tasks & Goals
- **Project 0**:\
    Introductory Python tutorial, including **Pac-Man Project 0** & an additional task of building a **Priority Queue** with an underlying **min-Heap**, using the `heapq` module.
- **Project 1**:\
    Pac-Man Project 1, focused on **Search Algorithms**, **modelling Problem States** & **Heuristic Functions**
    - DFS
    - BFS
    - Uniform-Cost Search
    - A* Search
    - Specific Problem (navigation, travelling salesman) modelling (starting state, goal state check, creating successor states)
    - Implementing & Experimenting with Heuristic Functions (admissable, optimal, greedy)
- **Project 2**:\
    Pac-Man Project 2, focused on **Multi-Agent Search** Algorithms & implementing **Evaluation Functions**.
    - Dummy Reflex Agent
    - MiniMax
    - Alpha-Beta Pruning
    - Expectimax
    - Implementing a custom Evaluation Function by experimenting & tuning on the considered parameters and their weights.
